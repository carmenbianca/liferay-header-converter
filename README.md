# Liferay Header Converter

This is a quickly written tool intended for the replacement of Liferay's
headers. It is written as part of my educational internship at Liferay. The
sending institution is NHL Stenden, Leeuwarden.

In short, these headers:

```

```

need to turn into:

```

```

## Usage

```
cd path/to/liferay-portal
python path/to/liferay-header-converter/generate_dates.py
python path/to/liferay-header-converter/replace.py
```

That's the basic usage. All the other stuff is code to assist me in the process.

The above commands use the date of the latest modification in the header. If you
want the creation date, use the following commands:

```
cd path/to/liferay-portal
python path/to-/liferay-header-converter/replace.py --creation-date
```
